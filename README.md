## Nexus Tutorial Additions

This repo contains additions to the Nexus tutorial that is provided in the Nexus docs. The beginning of the tutorial can be found (https://nexusjs.org/docs/getting-started/tutorial)[here]. While creating this API, I found (https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/typescript/graphql-auth)[this] repo helpful. There are obviously similarities between my additions and this repo.

Additions include the following:
* User model
* Connecting users to posts
* All user methods
* Password encryption
* User authentication

At this time, I have not written any tests for the added user or post methods.
